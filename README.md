# The Cocktail Cabinet #

The cocktail cabinet is an app that allows users to log in and build their digital liquor cabinet. Update your profile with the quantity of bottles you have in your physical liquor cabinet. Browse through all sorts of cocktails, sorted by category or by bottle. If you find a recipe that sounds good, save it to your profile. You can log out and log back in anytime you'd like to look through your liquor cabinet or access your favorite recipes!
